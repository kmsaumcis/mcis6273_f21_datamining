    "`homework/hw0`.   Put all of your files in that directory.  Then zip that directory,\n",

    "download it to your local machine, then upload the `.zip` to Blackboard.\n",

    "on the basics of using zip in Linux.\n",

    "## ASSIGNMENT TASKS\n",

    "\n",
    "As stated in the course announcement [Jupyter (https://jupyter.org)](https://jupyter.org) is the\n",

    "setup for this course so that we can operate in a cloud-hosted environment, free from\n",
    "some of the resource constraints of running Jupyter on your local machine (though you are free to set\n",

    "\n",
    "You have been given the information about the  Jupyter environment we have setup for our course, and\n",
    "the underlying Python environment will be using is the [Anaconda (https://anaconda.com)](https://anaconda.com)\n",
    "distribution.  It is not necessary for this assignment, but you are free to look at the multitude\n",
    "of packages installed with Anaconda, though we will not use the majority of them explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you will soon find out, Notebooks are an incredibly effective way to mix code with narrative\n",
    "and you can create cells that are entirely code or entirely Markdown.  Markdown (MD or `md`) is\n",
    "a highly readable text format that allows for easy documentation of text files, while allowing\n",
    "for HTML-based rendering of the text in a way that is style-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using Markdown frequently in this course, and you will learn that there are many different\n",
    "\"flavors\" or Markdown.  We will only be using the basic flavor, but you will benefit from exploring\n",
